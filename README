* How to use speedtest.rb

# Ensure the settings in config.rb are correct
# Ensure you can connect to the servers in config.rb without being prompted for a password
# Run ./speedtest.rb from the command line. Be patient: It can take 15 minutes (or longer) to run 3 tests to two servers with decent bandwidth!


* Example output

$ time ./speedtest.rb
